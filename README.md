# Yo Anon👾

I am building different stuffs. Sometimes they work, sometimes no. Either way, it's all lessons.

## What You'll Find

- **Random Projects**: Cool stuff I've thrown together.
- **Epic Fails**: Because failing is half the fun.
- **Weird Experiments**: Expect the unexpected.

## About Me

When I'm not messing with code:
- 🍿 Binging anime
- ⚽ Watching football

Dive in, take what you need, and maybe drop a star if you're feeling generous. Enjoy the chaos!
 ✌️
